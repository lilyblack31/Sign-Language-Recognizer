# Sign-Language-Recognizer
ShapeAI Project

American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals.
The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

I will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters. 
After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, I will train the network and test its performance. The process has been done for only 3 letters so far and can be increased to all letters of the English Language.
